			  ryanbabel is a personal site in my opinion its structured really well when you disable the css you can still tell what is what and what belongs where</p>
			  <p><img src="images/leroi_arthur.jpg" alt="le roi aruthr." /> <br />
			   Is a site for a hotel its really appealing to the eye and when you disable the css you can still understand what goes where; its very neat and clean/p>
			  <p><img src="images/heart_in_jar.jpg" alt="heart in a jar." /> <br />
			  Heart in a jar is a site for a music artist and out of the four sites I looked at its by far my favorite its very clean and is also very eye catching without the css the site is still functional and you can tell what is what</p>
			  <p><img src="images/shizuka.jpg" alt="shizuka." /> <br />
			  Is a site for a beauty salon its put together very nice I think structure wise compared to the other three this site is structured a lot differently but its still clear what belongs where when the css is disabled </p>
